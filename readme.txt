The Whoosh Traffic plugin provides a Rank Tracker and a Keyword Research plugin integrated right into your blog.

== Description ==

Whoosh Traffic's Rank Tracker plugin allows you to see where you rank
on Google and Bing directly from inside your WordPress blog.

See where your pages are ranked on Google today and also see a graph
of your rankings dating back to when you installed our plugin. At a
glance, see which of your Google rankings changed over time. And we'll
even send you an email every day with your current Google rankings for
all keywords you've imported into our system, and any page on your
site that is ranking for those keywords!

Whoosh Traffic's rank tracker tool supports ALL Google country codes,
ALL languages (including multi-byte languages like Japanese and
Chinese), and even features zip code support for United States zip
codes, so you can track where your company ranks for "pizza" in both
NYC and San Francisco, if you wish.

Whoosh Traffic searches Google just like a regular person who doesn't
know you would. We even show you the Google results page we found your
site on, so there's no question of where you're ranking!

Whoosh Traffic offers the most accurate rank tracker today. Try us out
and get rankings directly in WordPress. It's never been easier to see
where you rank on Google, and see your rankings change on a daily
basis!

NOTE: Our plugin requires a paid Whoosh Traffic account in order to
see your rankings. Join hundreds of other customers, from bloggers to
Fortune 500 companies, who use and love Whoosh Traffic. Sign up at
